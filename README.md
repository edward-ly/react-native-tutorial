# React Native Tutorial

A repository used as an exercise for learning to develop with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). The commits follow the official React Native tutorial which can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html).

## Technical Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). For more information on how to setup and develop your own React Native App, you can find the most recent version of the official README [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/README.md).

## Getting Started

> This app uses [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) to manage development dependencies, so install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary.

To build the app, just clone the repository at the desired commit and run `npm start`.

```shell
$ git clone <this repo> <project folder>
$ cd <project folder>
$ git checkout <commit>
$ npm start
```

This will install dependencies and start the app, after which a QR code will appear in the console.

Now, you can download the [Expo](https://expo.io/) client app from the App Store or Google Play Store onto your phone and scan the QR code to run the app.
